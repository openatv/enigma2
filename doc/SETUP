INTRODUCTION:
=============

Enigma2 is a massive open source project that has many contributors and 
add-ons.  Over time a number of alternative approaches to performing common 
tasks have evolved.  This document documents some conventions that can be 
adopted by all developers, contributors and skin authors to ensure that 
everyone can work independently but still achieve results that work together 
interchangeably.

Standard variable names are documented, together with code and skin coding 
conventions to assist in creating code that works more universally, with 
additional benefits from improved Setup screen load performance and reduction 
in merge issues between Enigma2 images.

Lastly, the document explains the operation and features of the refactored 
Setup screen interface ("Screen/Setup.py").


REFACTOR OF "Screens/Setup.py":
===============================

The refactor of the "Screens/Setup.py" code has been based on various 
features available in the main Enigma2 images.  That is, the code has been 
written to make the "Screens/Setup.py" a superset of capabilities from all 
the images.

The changes, even with the enhancements, can result in a significant 
reduction in time to generate any "Screens/Setup.py" based screen.  The 
time taken to build any Setup screen is slightly longer for the first 
screen item but then about 50 time faster for all subsequent searches.

Significant changes, in no particular order, are:

1)	All setup XML file data is cached into memory on the first access.  
	Every subsequent access will check if the source file has been 
	changed.  If so, the file will be reloaded and reprocessed.  If not, 
	the cached results are returned.  This change can significantly 
	improve "Screens/Setup.py" screen load times.

	This change also means that the GUI no longer has to be restarted to 
	allow changes to "setup.xml" to be processed by OpenPLi.

2)	Optimise, improve and enhance generation of Setup screen item lists.  
	This change allows the list to be processed once for display rather 
	than the two or three cycles in some previous versions.

3)	Create a log entry if the Setup screen has no valid entries.

4)	Remove remnants of the setup.xml "separation" attribute directive.  
	This feature is now offered via the skin parameter 
	"ConfigListSeperator".

5)	When enabled, always obey Setup screen sort setting.

6)	If "%s %s" is found in an item's "text" or "description" attribute 
	then replace it with the current box machine brand and model name.

7)	Move the description code from the "SetupSummary" class into the main 
	"Setup" class where it is used.

8) 	For OpenPLi add footnote support.  If the last character of an entry 
	item is an "*" then when this item is currently selected by the user 
	a footnote message will appear to advise the user that a restart 
	will be required if this item is changed.

9)	Add an option to provide "Setup" screen graphic based on matching the 
	setup "key" attribute with a graphic defined in a new "<setups>" 
	element in the skin.  This code is conditional on having compatible 
	changes in "skin.py".

10)	Enable the HELP button to allow users to obtain help while using any 
	"Screens/Setup.py" based screen.  To be fully operational these 
	changes also need to be accompanied by appropriate changes to 
	"Components/ConfigList.py".

	To properly implement HELP and clean up the ActionMaps, the ActionMap 
	and associated code should be removed from "Screens/Setup.py" and 
	integrated into the ActionMap in "Components/ConfigList.py".

11)	The "setup_key" skin facility appears to be unused.  The name has 
	been changed to "Setupkey" to better match existing skin names.  
	This option allows skin designers to create custom "Setup" based 
	screens.

	The "setup.xml" file's "setup" tag also offers a "skin" attribute to 
	also allow for the screen for that setup key to be specified.

	The order of screen selection is first look for a "skin" attribute 
	screen, then try for a "Setupkey" screen and finally use the 
	standard "Setup" screen.

12)	Perform a PEP8 clean-up of the code.

13)	Reorganise the imports and code blocks to improve readability of the 
	refactored code.

14)	Logic functionality has been added to the setup XML file.  The 
	addition of "if", "elif" and "else" elements allow for "item" 
	elements to be selected for inclusion or exclusion from any setup 
	based screen.

15)	The syntax consistency of the "if", "elif" and "item" elements is
	now checked when the setup XML file is loaded.  Issues are reported 
	in the log file.


STRUCTURE OF "setup.xml" FILES:
===============================

Syntax:
	
	<setupxml>
		<setup key="sample1" title="Sample1 settings">
			<item level="0" text="Configuration item 1" description="This is the description text that explains the purpose and settings of config item 1.">configItem1</item>
			<item level="0" text="Configuration item 2" description="This is the description text that explains the purpose and settings of config item 2.">configItem2</item>
		</setup>
		<setup key="sample2" title="Sample2 settings">
			<item level="0" text="Configuration item 3" description="This is the description text that explains the purpose and settings of config item 3.">configItem3</item>
			<item level="1" text="Configuration item 4" description="This is the description text that explains the purpose and settings of config item 4.">configItem4</item>
			<if level="2">
				<item text="Configuration item 5" description="This is the description text that explains the purpose and settings of config item 5.">configItem5</item>
			<elif conditional="self.configVariable.value != 'once'" />
				<item text="Configuration item 6" description="This is the description text that explains the purpose and settings of config item 6.">configItem6</item>
			<else />
				<item text="Configuration item 7" description="This is the description text that explains the purpose and settings of config item 7.">configItem7</item>
			</if>
		</setup>
	</setupxml>

The "setupxml" tag defines that the file is a setup configuration file. The 
"setupxml" tag has no attributes and should contain a list of one or more 
"setup" tag elements. Each of the "setup" tag elements should contain a list 
of one or more "item" or "if" elements.  Each "item" tag element must contain 
a configuration element that has been defined in "Components/UsageConfig.py" 
or elsewhere.  Each "if" tag element should contain logic attributes "level", 
"conditional" or "requires" to allow evaluation as to whether or not that 
element's content will be used for the Setup screen.

Each of the "setup" tags can have the following attributes:

	Attribute	Required	Description
	---------	--------	-----------
	"key"		Mandatory	This attribute is the reference name, 
					or key, used to identify this Setup 
					screen.  By convention, common usage 
					and agreement all keys should use 
					lowercase names.

	"title"		Mandatory	This attribute is the long form title 
					text used for the heading or title of 
					this setup screen.

	"showOpenWebif"	Optional	This attribute is used to signal that 
					this Setup screen should be made 
					available in OpenWebif.

	"requires"	Optional	This attribute is used to test is the 
					nominated requirements have been met 
					to enable the activation and use of 
					this Setup screen.  The "requires" 
					attribute value can be either the 
					name of a config variable without 
					the ".value" attribute, or the name 
					of a SystemInfo entry.  If the first 
					character of the attribute argument 
					is "!" then the argument logic is 
					inverted.

	"skin"		Optional	This attribute is used to specify an 
					override screen name defined in the 
					skin to be used to display this Setup 
					screen.

Each of the "if" or "elif" tags can have at least one of the "level", 
"conditional" or "requires" attributes as per the "item" tag as follows.

Each of the "item" tags can have the following attributes:

	Attribute	Required	Description
	---------	--------	-----------
	"text"		Mandatory	This attribute is the prompt text 
					that is displayed to the user when 
					activating this Setup screen.

	"description"	Recommended	This attribute is the help prompt or 
					information that can, and should, be 
					used to offer guidance to users in 
					when and how to set the associated 
					configuration option.  If this is 
					omitted no assistance or information 
					will be offered to users.

	"level"		Optional	The list of items that may be 
					displayed in any Setup screen is 
					dynamic. This attribute determines 
					the user interface setup mode or 
					level where this option may be 
					displayed.  The default level, if 
					not specified, is 0.

				Level=0 -> Basic / Normal / Simple or higher
				Level=1 -> Advanced / Intermediate or higher
				Level=2 -> Expert
				Level=9 -> Deactivate this entry

	"conditional"	Optional	This attribute allows for programmed 
					logic to decide is this item is 
					eligible for display in the Setup 
					screen.  The "conditional" attribute 
					value is a Python expression that 
					must evaluate to a value that can be 
					converted to a Boolean.  It is 
					evaluated in the context of a Setup 
					class instance, and in the expression 
					self refers to that instance (which 
					is mainly useful for classes that 
					derive from Setup, like 
					MovieBrowserConfiguration).

	"requires"	Optional	This attribute allows for "SystemInfo" 
					or "config" variables to be used to 
					enable display of the item.  If the 
					first character of the attribute 
					argument is "!" then the argument 
					logic is inverted.

	NOTE 1:	The text in the "text" and "description" attributes will 
		be processed by the language translation system.

	NOTE 2:	After the text in the "text" and "description" attributes 
		has been translated any occurrence of the string "%s %s" will 
		be replaced by the current make and model of the device upon 
		which the code is running.

	NOTE 3: If the last character of the "text" attribute is "*" then 
		when this item is currently selected by the user a footnote 
		message will appear to advise the user that a restart will be 
		required if this item is changed.

The payload or data element of the "item" tag should be the config element 
defined in "Components/UsageConfig.py", or elsewhere, to be managed / changed 
by the encompassing item tag.

	</screen>


SKIN "Setups" SUPPORT ELEMENT:
==============================

Syntax:

	<setups>
		<setup key="default" image="setup_default.png" />
		<setup key="sample1" image="setup_key.png" />
	</setups>

This element is optional but if defined allows a skin designer to associate 
a graphical image with any "Screens/Setup.py" based screen.  The "setups" 
tag element has no attributes and contains a list of "setup" tag elements.

Each "setup" tag element must contain two attributes:

	key	This attribute is the value of the key attribute from a 
		setup.xml file.  If the keys match then this entry defines 
		a graphical image that is to be used when the nominated 
		Setup screen is displayed.

	image	This attribute is the pathname of the graphical image that 
		is to be associated with the Setup screen identified by the 
		"key" attribute.

There is a special "key" attribute with the name "default".  This entry, 
if defined, assigns a default graphical image to be used in ALL 
"Screens/Setup.py" screens that do not have a specifically assigned 
image.


CONCLUSION:
===========

For all the Enigma2 images there is a significant difference in facilities 
offered by the "Screens/Setup.py code.  This proposal outlines what I 
believe to be a conservative approach to making a significant and beneficial 
change in unifying and standardising the operation of "Setup" screens across 
the Enigma2 UI.
