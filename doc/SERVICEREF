=== FLAGS ===

noFlags          = 0x000   0
isDirectory      = 0x001   1  SHOULD enter  (implies mustDescent)
mustDescent      = 0x002   2  cannot be played directly
canDescent       = 0x004   4  supports enterDirectory/leaveDirectory
flagDirectory    = 0x007   7  (isDirectory|mustDescent|canDescent)
shouldSort       = 0x008   8  should be ASCII-sorted according to service_name.
                              great for directories.
hasSortKey       = 0x010  16  has a sort key in data[3]. not having a sort key
                              implies 0.
sort1            = 0x020  32  sort key is 1 instead of 0
isMarker         = 0x040  64  Marker
isGroup          = 0x080 128  is a group of services
isNumberedMarker = 0x100 256  use together with isMarker,
                              to force the marker to be numbered
isInvisible      = 0x200 512  use together with isMarker and isNumberedMarker,
                              to force an empty number

NOTE 1: MPEG-2 SD material should use this type.
NOTE 2: MPEG-1 Layer 2 audio material should use this type.
NOTE 3: For discussion of the use of these values, see clause I.2.3 and TS 101 547-2 (3D Guidelines of Frame Compatible 3D-TV).

Defined in class eServiceID in enigma2/lib/dvb/idvb.h.

Service types 0x01, 0x02, 0x04, 0x0A (10), 0x11 (17), 0x13 (19), 0x16 (22),
0x18 (24), 0x19 (25) and 0x1B (27) are documented as being used
in enigma2/RecordTimer.py.

Service types 0x86 (134) and 0xC3 (195) are used without further
explanation in query paths in servicerefs for bouquets, eg:
1:7:1:0:0:0:0:0:0:0:(type == 1) || (type == 17) || (type == 22) || (type == 25) || (type == 134) || (type == 195)

Service type 0x0D (13) in combination with
flags 0x340 (832) (isInvisible | isNumberedMarker | isMarker) is used
as a filler in /etc/enigma2/userbouquet.terrestrial_lcn.tv
and /etc/enigma2/userbouquet.terrestrial_lcn.radio. This appears to
be a non-standard use.

This field is also used as a marker count when REFTYPE == iDVB
and FLAGS & isNumberedMarker.

=== DVB fields ===

SID         - Stream ID

TSID        - Transport stream ID

ONID        - Originating network ID

NS          - DVB namespace

PARENT_SID  - Service parent Stream ID

PARENT_TSID - Service parent Transport stream ID

=== "UNUSED" field ===

Is in fact used for servicerefs with idServiceMP3

0    no buffering
1    buffering enabled
3    progressive download and buffering enabled


Documented in enigma2/lib/service/servicemp3.cpp.

=== PATH ===

Path specifying the source of the service data. E.g. filesystem
path name for files being played, URL for streaming services,
directory pathname for isDirectory/mustDescent/canDescent services
in a file system or a search expression for broarcast service
directories (bouquets). Empty for broadcast services and HDMI IN.

--- idDVB search expression ---

Used to select the services contained in an idDVB service marked
as a directory (any of isDirectory|mustDescent|canDescent).

search_path ::= sel_expr bouquet_expr | bouquet_expr sel_expr

sel_expr ::= [ compar | paren_compar ( ( "&&" | "||" ) paren_compar )+ ]

paren_compar ::= "(" compar ")"

compar ::= type ( "==" | "!=" ) <val>

type ::= "name" | "provider" | "type" | "bouquet" | "satellitePosition"
                | "channelID" | "flags"

bouquet_expr ::= [ from ] [ order_by ] | [ order_by ] [ from ]

order_by ::= "ORDER" "BY" type

from ::= "FROM" ( "BOUQUET" '"' <name> '"' | "SATELLITES" | "PROVIDERS" )

A <name> may contain any character except '"'.

Type "name" cannot be used in comparisons. Otherwise in comparisons, <val>
is an decimal integer, except for channelID where it is a 16-digit hexadecimal
in the form NNNNNNNNTTTTOOOO where NNNNNNNN is the namespace id, TTTT
is the transport stream id and OOOO is the originating network id.

The selection expression form is simple. If there is only one comparison,
parentheses may not be used. If there is more than one, each comparison
muse be enclosed in parentheses. Evaluation is strictly left-to-right.
Evaluation order cannot be modified by the use of parentheses.

(type == 1) && (provider == 3) || (type == 2) && (provider == 4)

is evaluated as

(((type == 1) && (provider == 3)) || (type == 2)) && (provider == 4)

=== NAME ===

REFTYPE-dependent text data associated with the service ref. Used,
for example, to store additional filename extension mappings in
idFile servicerefs where any flagDirectory bits are set, to store
the playlist name in idServiceMP3 servicerefs, and to store service
name information in idDVB servicerefs.
