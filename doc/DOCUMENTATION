Text and Documentation Style Guide for Enigma2
----------------------------------------------

Written by IanSav -  7-May-2022  (Thanks to JBleyel for his input.)


This document is a collection of notes and suggestions that should be 
considered when writing text for display in Enigma2 and/or plugins.  The 
same considerations should be applied to any documentation being written 
for Enigma2, and/or plugins.

This is a work in progress. Suggestions, corrections and enhancements are 
welcomed.

Some of the key points, so far, include:
1)	All text in code must be in en_US (English US).

2)	Try to write concisely. Shorter and more meaningful text is often 
	easier to understand.  It is also usually easier to translate.

3)	English text should not be compromised to suit any single alternate 
	language. Where translation issues present themselves reasonable 
	compromises should be discussed. For example "Storage" can be 
	ambiguous in some translations so an additional word, like "Disk 
	Storage" or "RAM Storage" may help for translations yet still keep 
	the English meaning intact.

4)	All titles and button should have the first letter of every word 
	capitalized.

5)	When titles or buttons are referenced in text the capitalization 
	should be retained.

6)	All references to buttons on the remote control should be in all 
	upper case. E.g. OK, RED, GREEN, MENU, etc.

7)	All descriptions text should be written in concise English with 
	proper and appropriate punctuation.

8)	Currently help text does not include punctuation but this is up 
	for review.

9)	There should only be one space after punctuation marks. Extra 
	spacing for readability to separate options etc may still be 
	appropriate.

10)	There is no need for any text to be translated in en.po or en_US.po.

that are very popular:
